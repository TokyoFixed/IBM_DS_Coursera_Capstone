# IBM Applied Data Science Capstone Project - SpaceX

**Introduction**

This capstone project will predict if the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage rocket will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.


**Objectives:**

The objective of this project is to determing the price of each launch and to predict if the Falcon 9 rocket first stage will land successfully. This will be done by using the data provided by SpaceX. The data will be cleaned and analyzed to determine the best model to predict if the first stage will land successfully. The model will be used to predict if the first stage will land successfully for future launches.
